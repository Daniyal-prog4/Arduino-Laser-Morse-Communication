About the Project
# Arduino-Laser-Morse-Communication
A simple Arduino project that uses a laser module and an LDR to send and receive Morse code. The Arduino converts text into laser pulses, and the LDR detects them to decode the message. Great for learning optical communication and sensor interfacing.
